### Report Automation Matrix
Previously, the creation of complex reports demanded over 200 hours/per report. By integrating an automation flow and employing Python data scripts within our Tableau Prep builder flow, we've streamlined the process to under 10 hours. This enhancement not only accelerates our reporting speed but also significantly augments our capacity to drive impactful institutional campaigns. (Images used are for illustrative purposes only)
