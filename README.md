### Turnaround Dashboard
  - To enhance operational efficiency, I created the turnaround metrics and dashboard using Python to benchmark performance. The SQL Turnaround Calculation serves as the input data for the Python dashboard, which is integrated into the Python flow.

### Report Automation Matrix
- Integrating an sql and Python data scripts within our Tableau Prep builder flow has streamlined the process, reducing reporting time from 200 to a couple of hours.  
- Augments our capacity to drive impactful institutional campaigns.
