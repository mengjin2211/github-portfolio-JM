### Turnaround Dashboard
  - To enhance operational efficiency, I created the turnaround metrics and dashboard using Python to benchmark performance. The SQL Turnaround Calculation serves as the input data for the Python dashboard, which is integrated into the Python flow.

### Report Automation Matrix
- Creating complex reports used to take over 200 hours per report, resulting in backlogs. Integrating an automation flow and employing Python data scripts within our Tableau Prep builder flow has streamlined the process to a couple of hours.  
- This enhancement not only accelerates our reporting speed but also significantly augments our capacity to drive impactful institutional campaigns. (Images used are for illustrative purposes only)
