The anlytics team helped the Operations team find out the "theme" of the client request reasons as we wanted to reduce them.

The following ML project was completed to enhance client support.

I'm unable to share the company script due to confidentiality agreements, but I can describe the projects I've worked on in general terms

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Obtain data from customer portal.
Ranking:
The code creates a ranking for requests based on their creation dates within each package.
It filters out the reason code 'FREE' and analyzes how many of them were issued as initial defects.

Custom Request Reason Cluster:
Text preprocessing is performed on the 'REASON_TEXT' column of this dataset, including removing unwanted characters, tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and stemming.

Tokenizing:
     stemmer = SnowballStemmer('english')
     def lemmatize_stemming(text):
         return stemmer.stem(WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize(text,pos='v'))
     def preprocess(text):
         result = []
         for token in gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(text):
             if token not in gensim.parsing.preprocessing.STOPWORDS and len(token) > 3:
                 result.append(lemmatize_stemming(token))
         return result

BoW and TF-IDF models are created from the preprocessed text.
     lda_model = gensim.models.LdaMulticore(bag_of_words_corpus, num_topics = 20, id2word= dictionary, passes = 2, workers = 2)
     lda_model_tfidf = gensim.models.LdaMulticore(corpus_tfidf, num_topics = 20, id2word = dictionary, passes = 2, workers = 4)

Bag of Words is constructed using the Gensim library, and TF-IDF scores are calculated.
Both models are prepared for further analysis.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Model:

LDA models are trained using both BoW and TF-IDF representations.
Topics are extracted from the models, and each client request document is labeled with a topic.

Performance Evaluation and Testing:
Evaluate the performance of the LDA models by classifying sample documents into topics.
It tests the models on an unseen document to predict its topic.
