# SQL 
I developed a postgreSQL function that handles the complex inheritance &hierachy and retrieves report to enable bulk-processing. 
Tools: CTE, Recursive CTE, user-defined function 
Positive impact: 10 hr to 20 hr/weekly manual processing saved for the meta data management person  

I'm unable to share the company script due to confidentiality agreements, but I can describe the projects I've worked on in general terms below. 

Here's a brief description of the function's logic:
My function first checks if the a certain attribute exists in the specified hierachy level (master, sub, ssub, sssub ).
Depending on the new document hierachy level, it executes different queries to fetch data from the database.
Each query retrieves distinct member IDs along with their corresponding details such as name, email, and attribute selections.
The function handles cases where certain levels are not populated, marking them as hierachy level.
The retrieved data is ordered by various filters.
Overall, this function fetch user data based on attribute selections and their corresponding levels, making the data ready for bulk upload.
